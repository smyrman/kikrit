"""kikrit-admin.py supplies an easy wrapper for some django_kikrit/manage.py
commands (and more). It is meant to be an easy to use commnad line tool that
makes the most common administrative tasks easy.

Available command argumets are:
    help    Show this text, or print help about a specifc command
    install Install database (according to settings) and load initial data
    backup  Backup your database to a 'json fixture' in your bacup directory
    migrate Doens nothing (Will be implemented when needed)

Deprecated commands that still work are:
    backup multiline  Issuing only 'backup' now does what this did (file
                      formating)
    git-update        Shorthand for 'backup', 'git pull', 'rm kikrit_prod.db'
                      and 'django_kikrit/manage.py load_data'.
